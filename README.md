2. Drag `GW2Kit.framework` into your project
3. Import the GW2 header `#import <GW2Kit/GW2Kit.h>`

## How does it work?
### Item Example 
```objc
//Find item by id
[GWKItem itemWithItemId:@"28445" callback:^(NSError *error, GWKItem* object) {
	NSLog(@"Name : %@", object.name);
    NSLog(@"Type : %@", object.type);
    NSLog(@"Level : %ld", object.level);
 }];
```
```
Name : Strong Soft Wood Longbow of Fire
Type : GWKItemTypeWeapon
Level : 44
```
### Wvw Match Example
```
//Fin match id by a server id, 2103 is Augury rock server
NSString* matchId = [GWKHelpers fetchMatchIdWithServerId:@"2103"];
//GWKMatch from match id
[GWKMatch matchWithMatchId:matchId callback:^(NSError *error, GWKMatch* object) {
	NSLog(@"All structure %@", [object structuresDetailsAllMap]);
    NSLog(@"Structure Red Home : %@", object.redMap.structuresDetails);
}];
```
```
 All structure {
    "blue_camp" = 7;
    "blue_castle" = 1;
    "blue_keep" = 4;
    "blue_tower" = 8;
    "green_camp" = 9;
    "green_castle" = 0;
    "green_keep" = 4;
    "green_tower" = 7;
    "red_camp" = 8;
    "red_castle" = 0;
    "red_keep" = 4;
    "red_tower" = 9;
}
Structure Red Home : {
    "blue_camp" = 1;
    "blue_castle" = 0;
    "blue_keep" = 0;
    "blue_tower" = 0;
    "green_camp" = 2;
    "green_castle" = 0;
    "green_keep" = 0;
    "green_tower" = 0;
    "red_camp" = 3;
    "red_castle" = 0;
    "red_keep" = 3;
    "red_tower" = 4;
}
```
### Use Partial Object
```
//Create Partial Item
GWKPartialItem *partialItem = [[GWKPartialItem alloc] init];
partialItem.objectId = @"28445";
//Item from Patial Item
[GWKRequest requestItemFromPartialObject:partialItem callback:^(NSError *error, GWKItem* object) {
	NSLog(@"Name : %@", object.name);
    NSLog(@"Type : %@", object.type);
    NSLog(@"Level : %ld", object.level);
}];
```
```
Name : Strong Soft Wood Longbow of Fire
Type : GWKItemTypeWeapon
Level : 44
```
